[Circuit Playground Bluefruit UF2 Firmware File](https://adafru.it/HCh)

Install this firmware on your CPB and then power it up near your Android phone.

Bluetooth and Location services must be enabaled and you must allow the Location permission for the app to function.
The app should pretty well guide you into the right direction through setup process to get it working.
Launch the app and follow the on screen prompts to get started.


When you are done remember to disable Bluetooth and Location services if you aren't otherwise using them to save battery.
