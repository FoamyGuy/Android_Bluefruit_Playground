# Bluefruit Playground app for Android

Debug APK direct link: [https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Android_Bluefruit_Playground/raw/master/Bluefruit_Playground_v01_DEBUG.apk](https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Android_Bluefruit_Playground/raw/master/Bluefruit_Playground_v01_DEBUG.apk)

The app should pretty well guide you into the right direction through setup process to get it working.

When you are done remember to click the notification to disconnect and exit the service.

Current Known Issues / Todo list:

* Disconnect button in top left of modules activity does nothing. Should verify with user and finish service
* modules activity on back press should ask user if they want to finish the service
* Service should finish itself after some time idle
* Accelerometer activity should hide the ugly webview loading
* Neopixel animations can sometimes continue some frames after pressing the stop icon.

If you run across any trouble please make an issue.
